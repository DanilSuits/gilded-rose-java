The Gilded Rose kata was introduced by [Terry Hughes in 2011][1]

The baseline implementation here is not an attempt to re-create the behavior
of the c# implementation in java.  Instead, the goal was to achieve a viable
java implementation with as few text changes to the code as I could manage.

One place where that may have significant implications in the code is
String equality.  String literals compiled into the program should all
be equivalent, because [interning][3]. But input data is not automatically
interned, which means that reference equality isn't the right test
to be using in `com.vocumsineratio.gildedrose.console.Program.UpdateQuality`.

Working with legacy code is always exciting. 


If you are interested in other starting points, [Emily Bache][2] has collected
quite a few.
